The total cost of performing proactive work that aims to enhance the public support service and internal support processes and is not directly related to customer support. This cost includes all relevant taxes and is calculated in USD on a gross basis.<br>
Here are the details of the calculation:
1.	**Proactive work** involves events from the Support Workflow application. In simpler terms, proactive work refers to everything that remains after subtracting the Support Center work hours and any types of leaves from the regular work schedule (which is typically 168 hours per month).
2.	The **support developers** who are included in the calculation also include Support Chapter Managers and Squad/Tribe Leads with the role of Support Ticket Processing.
3.	Specific occasions of **work on weekends** that were approved in the Support Workflow app are taken into consideration. However, **individual bonuses** or **specific deductions** for things like equipment are not taken into account.
4.	**Individual salaries** that do not correspond to the employee's level standard salary and **custom work schedules** of less than 40 hours per week (e.g., students) are not considered in the calculation.
