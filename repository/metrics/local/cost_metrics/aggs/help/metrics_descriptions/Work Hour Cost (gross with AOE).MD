The cost of one hour of work for a specific employee is determined by their professional level and considers both paid and unpaid leaves, as well as any payments for working on holidays, and taking into account any operational and administrative costs. This cost includes all relevant taxes and is calculated in USD on a gross basis.<br><br>
Here are the details of the calculation:
1.	Spontaneous **work** on support tickets **on weekends** is not taken into consideration. Specific occasions of **work on weekends** that were approved in the Support Workflow app are taken into consideration.

2.	**Individual salaries** that do not correspond to the employee's level standard salary and **custom work schedules** of less than 40 hours per week (e.g., students) are not considered in the calculation.
