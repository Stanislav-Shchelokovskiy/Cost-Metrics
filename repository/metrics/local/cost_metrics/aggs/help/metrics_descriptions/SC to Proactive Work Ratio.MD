The ratio factor represents the number of hours allocated to Support Center work compared to proactive work.<br><br>
Here are the details of the calculation:
1.	The **work time** of the Support Center is determined based on audit records and Support Workflow events. If an employee makes changes to a support ticket that requires saving, one hour is considered as a work hour in the Support Center. The cost of the ticket is calculated based on the **actual** work hours, including overtime, and taking into consideration proactive work events from the Workflow.
2.	Only certain **types of tickets** are considered: Question, Bug Report, and Suggestion where the ticket **owner is a customer**, not an employee.
3.	**Proactive work** involves events from the Support Workflow application. In simpler terms, proactive work refers to everything that remains after subtracting the Support Center work hours and any types of leaves from the regular work schedule (which is typically 168 hours per month).
3.	The **support developers** who are included in the calculation also include Support Chapter Managers and Squad/Tribe Leads with the role of Support Ticket Processing.
4.	The **development team** includes Developers, Product Managers, Technical Writers, and Chapter/Tribe/Squad Leads who do not have the Support Ticket Processing role. Tribes with development-only support, such as TestCafe and IDE, are also considered part of the development team.
5.  Spontaneous **work on weekends** is not taken into consideration.
