The average number of iterations per hour is calculated by dividing the total number of iterations by the total number of work hours in the support center.<br><br>
Here are the details of the calculation:
1.	The **work time** of the Support Center is determined based on audit records and Support Workflow events. If an employee makes changes to a support ticket that requires saving, one hour is considered as a work hour in the Support Center. The cost of the ticket is calculated based on the **actual** work hours, including overtime, and taking into consideration proactive work events from the Workflow.
2.	Only certain **types of tickets** are considered: Question, Bug Report, and Suggestion where the ticket **owner is a customer**, not an employee.
3.	**Vacation and sick leaves** are proportionally allocated between the Support Center and proactive work.
4.	Spontaneous **work** on support tickets **on weekends** is not taken into consideration. Payment for **work on holidays** is considered. However, **individual bonuses** or **specific deductions** for things like equipment are not taken into account.
5.  **Individual salaries** that do not correspond to the employee's level standard salary and **custom work schedules** of less than 40 hours per week (e.g., students) are not considered in the calculation.
