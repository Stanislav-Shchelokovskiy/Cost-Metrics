The cost of one hour of work for a specific employee is determined by their professional level and considers both paid and unpaid leaves, as well as any payments for working on holidays. This cost includes all relevant taxes and is calculated in USD on a gross basis.<br>
Here are the details of the calculation:
1.	Specific occasions of **work on weekends** that were approved in the Support Workflow app are taken into consideration. However, **individual bonuses** or **specific deductions** for things like equipment are not taken into account.
2.	**Individual salaries** that do not correspond to the employee's level standard salary and **custom work schedules** of less than 40 hours per week (e.g., students) are not considered in the calculation.
