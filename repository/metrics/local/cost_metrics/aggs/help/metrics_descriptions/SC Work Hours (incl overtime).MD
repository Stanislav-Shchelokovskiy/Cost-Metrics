The total amount of time a support developer spends on support center tickets.<br><br>
Here are the details of the calculation:
1.	The **work time** of the Support Center is determined based on audit records and Support Workflow events. If an employee makes changes to a support ticket that requires saving, one hour is considered as a work hour in the Support Center. The cost of the ticket is calculated based on the **actual** work hours, including overtime.
2.	Only certain **types of tickets** are considered: Question, Bug Report, and Suggestion where the ticket **owner is a customer**, not an employee.
