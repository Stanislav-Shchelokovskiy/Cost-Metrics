The total cost of processing individual iteration within any support ticket. This cost includes all relevant taxes and is calculated in USD on a gross basis.<br>
Here are the details of the calculation:
1.	The **work time** of the Support Center is determined based on audit records. If an employee makes changes to a support ticket that requires saving, one hour is considered as a work hour in the Support Center. The cost of the ticket is calculated based on the **actual** work hours, including overtime.
2.	Only certain **types of tickets** are considered: Question, Bug Report, and Suggestion where the ticket **owner is a customer**, not an employee.
3.	The **support developers** who are included in the calculation also include Support Chapter Managers and Squad/Tribe Leads with the role of Support Ticket Processing. The Head of Support from the Management Tribe is not included.
4.	The **development team** includes Developers, Product Managers, Technical Writers, and Chapter/Tribe/Squad Leads who do not have the Support Ticket Processing role. Tribes with development-only support, such as TestCafe and IDE, are also considered part of the development team.
5.	**Vacation and sick leaves** are proportionally allocated between the Support Center and proactive work.
6.	Spontaneous **work** on support tickets **on weekends** is not taken into consideration. Payment for **work on holidays** is considered. However, **individual bonuses** or **specific deductions** for things like equipment are not taken into account.
7.	**Individual salaries** that do not correspond to the employee's level standard salary and **custom work schedules** of less than 40 hours per week (e.g., students) are not considered in the calculation.
